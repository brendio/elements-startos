# Elements (Liquid)

Elements Core (`elementsd`) packaged for StartOS as a **Liquid mainnet
(`liquidv1`) full node**.

Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain operated by a federation. It enables fast
(1-minute blocks), confidential transfers of Bitcoin as **L-BTC**, and the
issuance of other digital assets. Because Liquid is a federated sidechain, this
package syncs and validates the **Liquid** chain — not the Bitcoin mainnet
chain.

## What this package is for

This package exists to provide **Liquid (L-BTC) RPC functionality to other
StartOS services**. Its primary consumer is **PeerSwap**, which uses an
`elementsd` RPC backend to perform Liquid submarine swaps. Any StartOS app that
needs a Liquid node can depend on it.

It exposes:

- A **JSON-RPC interface** on the StartOS internal network at
  `elements.startos:7041`.
- A **`peerswap` wallet**, pre-created on first run.
- An **RPC cookie** that dependent packages can mount and read.

## Standalone Liquid node (no peg-in validation)

This package runs with `validatepegin=0`, meaning it does **not** run an
embedded Bitcoin Core to validate Liquid peg-ins against the Bitcoin chain.
This keeps the resource footprint small (you do not need a synced Bitcoin node
alongside it) while still running a full, validating Liquid node. This is the
correct mode for swap/wallet use cases such as PeerSwap.
